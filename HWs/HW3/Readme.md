# MEC 529: Introduction to Robotics - Homework 3

## Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB code and report for Homework 3 of the MEC 529: Introduction to Robotics course, Spring 2023. 


## Repository Structure
- **`Matrix_log`**: MATLAB function that takes R (rotation matrix) and returns the corresponding so(3) representation of exponential coordinates.
- **`rotation_mtrix`**: MATLAB function to compute the rotation matrix \( R \) given a unit axis \( \hat{\omega} \) and angle \( \theta \).
- **`skew_symmetric`**: MATLAB function that takes the vector form of omega and convert it to skew-symmetric.
- **`vectorize`**: MATLAB function that takes the ske-symmetric form of omega and converts it to vector.
