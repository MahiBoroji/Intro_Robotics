# MEC 529: Introduction to Robotics - Homework 1

## Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB code for Homework 1 of the MEC 529: Introduction to Robotics course, Spring 2023. 
The assignment focuses on the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and Jacobian computation of a 2R planar robot. The workspace of the robot is also analyzed and visualized.

## Repository Structure
- **`FK_2R.m`**: MATLAB function for computing the forward kinematics of the 2R planar robot.
- **`IK_2R.m`**: MATLAB function for computing the inverse kinematics of the 2R planar robot.
- **`J_2R.m`**: MATLAB function for computing the Jacobian of the 2R planar robot.
